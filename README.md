# Overview
MyBrokeMeter is a simple experiment with MPESA (AliPay) MiniProgramStudio. This is a simple miniapp that lets you know how much money you have left to your Broke Level / 0 ðŸ˜….

## Motivation
Sometimes its easy to lose track of how much money you're spent over the entire day/week/month and you later find out that you don't have 'enough month' left at the end of the money ðŸ™ƒ. So you proceed to languish in relative obscurity as you figure out what to do next. I built this after having made a few poor decisions in April and thought it would be cool if i could build Safaricom Mini App Platform and push it to the MiniApp Store where I'll be able to get my current balance and set alerts on my rate of spending. I also thought it would be cool to experiment how to make relatively trivial app with MiniProgramStudio.

## Use
Clone this repo after downloading [MiniProgramStudio](https://mpesaminiapps.safaricom.co.ke/downloads) to run the app.
